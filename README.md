# MachineLearning-SVM
Images of handwritten digits: MNISTdata.mat, prog2. The data represents a subsampling of the full MNIST data set available in http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

In this project, I will develop code for training and testing an SVM classifier with nonlinear kernel.

Using my implementation of the SVM classifier,
compare multi-class classification performance of two different voting schemes:
i. one versus the rest
ii. one versus one
To analyze accuracy, I will produce and analyze the multiclass confusion matrix in addition to examining the overall error rate.
